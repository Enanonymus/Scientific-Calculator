A calculator that can add, substract, multiply, divide, make powers (did I say that correctly?), do logarithms, sin, cos, tan and square roots. I made this for myself to understand C++ a little bit more
I didn't want to take the time to make it look well or anything. I was just proving myself that I can do this.
